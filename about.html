            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is <strong>Eden Kim</strong>, and I am a senior majoring in
                Computer Science with a minor in Game Design and Development.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently taking <em>Accessible Computing</em> because I believe
                accessibility is essential to creating meaningful and inclusive
                interactive experiences. Whether designing games, virtual environments,
                or applications, technology should be usable by as many people as possible.
            </p>

            <h2>Academic & Career Goals</h2>

            <h3>Why Accessible Computing Matters to Me</h3>
            <p>
                A great game or application is built entirely around the user and how
                they interact with the system. Accessibility ensures that users with
                different abilities are not excluded from these experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                My long-term goal is to start my own game studio focused on immersive
                <strong>VR experiences</strong>. Understanding accessibility principles
                will help me design games that are both engaging and inclusive from the start.
            </p>

            <h2>Accessibility Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I am especially interested in how accessibility intersects with
                <em>game design</em> and <em>virtual reality</em>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Designing accessible controls for VR and 3D environments</li>
                <li>Improving usability for players with motor or visual impairments</li>
                <li>Inclusive UI and UX design</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you’re interested in similar topics, I’d love to collaborate on a
                team project!
